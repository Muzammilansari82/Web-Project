        <p>This Cookie Policy (the "Cookie Policy") describes the different types of cookies or similar technologies
            (otherwise referred to here as a “cookie” or “cookies”) that are used in connection with the websites and
            other digital properties managed by the International Olympic Committee (“IOC”) either alone or in
            cooperation with the Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage (the “Foundation”). These digital
            properties are referred to in this Cookie Policy and our Cookies Settings as the “Digital Platforms”.
        </p>
        <p> When we refer to ‘’we’’, ‘’our’’ or “us” in this Cookie Policy, we are referring to the IOC and, where
            applicable, to the Foundation.
        </p>
        <p> The Foundation is engaged in those Digital Platforms that relate to the Olympic Museum (in
            particular https://www.olympics.com/museum, https://museumshop.olympics.com); and the Olympic Studies Centre
            (in particular https://www.olympics.com/ioc/olympic-studies-centre, https://library.olympics.com/).
        </p>
        When we refer to “you” or “your” we refer to you as a user of one or more of the Digital Platforms.
        <p>
            We use cookies to collect certain data while you are browsing the Digital Platforms, in order to distinguish
            you as a user, either for the duration of your visit (“session cookies”) or when you return (“persistent
            cookies”).</p>

        <h1> 1) WHAT IS A COOKIE?</h1>
        We use different types of cookies, including:

        <ul>
            <li>Strictly Necessary cookies that enable you to navigate our Digital Platforms and, in some markets,
                enable us to provide an optimised service. These cookies are necessary for the Digital Platforms to
                function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually set in response to actions made by
                you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or
                filling in forms. In some markets, we set these cookies so that we may review the performance of our
                Digital Platforms. You can set your browser to block or alert you to these cookies, but some parts of
                the Digital Platforms will not then work</li>
            <li>Functional cookies that enhance the functionality and personalisation of our Digital Platforms by
                storing your preferences. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of the services available
                via that Digital Platform may not function properly.
            </li>
            <li> Performance and Analytics cookies collect certain information that allow us to improve the performance
                of our Digital Platforms and help us to provide you with what we believe to be the best user experience.
                These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance
                of our Digital Platforms. These cookies also allow us to build a profile of your interests and browsing
                patterns, for the purpose of personalising your experience and offering you the most relevant content.
                They help us to know how our Digital Platforms perform and which pages are the most and least popular
                and to see how visitors move around the Digital Platforms. If you do not allow these cookies we will not
                be able to learn more about the use and performance of our Digital Platforms and your experience will
                not be as personalised and relevant to you. </li>
            <li>Marketing and Advertising cookies that enable the tailoring of online advertising based on your browsing
                activity and the location from which you access our Digital Platforms. These cookies include cookies set
                by our advertising partners. The cookies are used (i) by us to measure traffic to our Digital Platforms
                and for the purpose of personalising services and offering you the most relevant content, and (ii) by us
                and by our partners to build a profile and to show you and other people relevant adverts and content
                both on our Digital Platforms as well as on other sites. If you do not allow these cookies, you will
                continue to see online advertising and content, but that advertising and content will be less tailored
                to you.</li>
              <li>  Social Media cookies. These cookies are set by social media providers and include cookies that are set
                by the social media services that we have added to the Digital Platforms. For example, this includes
                social media services that enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are
                capable of tracking your browser across websites and building up a profile of your interests to show you
                relevant content and ads on those social media platforms. This may impact the content and messages you
                see on other websites you visit, including social media platforms. If you do not allow these cookies you
                may not be able to use or see the social media sharing tools.</li>
                The details of the cookies for each category (session/persistent cookies, expiration time, cookies used,
                first or third party cookie) are available in the Cookies Settings on each Digital Platform.</li>
